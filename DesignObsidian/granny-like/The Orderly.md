Idea for location: Old Folks Home - Keeps that granny vibe, without being about granny, but instead being about the Orderly? Instead of 5 days, you will have 5 "Treatments" 
1. Basket Weaving
2. Movie Time
3. Jigsaw Puzzle
4. Medicine
5. (Bonus Treatment) Family Visit
6. Nighty Night (The Chokey?)

As each of the treatments happen it gets later in the day and the environment gets dimmer and more ominous, but items get sparklier to see them better maybe? Also things start to ware down, and become decrepit and spooky things might happen like people hiding behind walls and what not. (Obvious scope stretch goals)

Multiple Endings
* First ending most important: Exit through the [[Front Gate]] 
* One through a super secret way that is the good ending

Looks like the key things are that you are locked in an enclosed environment.
