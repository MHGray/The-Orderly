Generally it should be easier for the player to see things in this order:
* [[Obstacles]]
* [[Locks]]
* [[Tools]]
* [[Keys]]
* [[Secrets]] - Scope Dependent
They see Obstacles so the look for tools, they see locks so they look for keys. This won't always be the case but it should be most of the time. In addition, each item can generally prohibit the things below it. So an Obstacle could be in the way of finding a lock, tool, or key, but a tool, can only gate finding a key. This should keep it so that as the player finds tools and keys they aren't unlocking keys with keys and tools with tools. This will be incredibly important when it comes to randomizing where tools and keys can be found. 

[[Asset List]]

Idea for location: Old Folks Home - Keeps that granny vibe, without being about granny, but instead being about the Orderly? Instead of 5 days, you will have 5 "Treatments" 
1. Basket Weaving
2. Movie Time
3. Jigsaw Puzzle
4. Medicine
5. (Bonus Treatment) Family Visit
6. Nighty Night (The Chokey?)
Hey look, I just made 6 rooms that I can make, oh boy.

How it differs from Granny - You will not have access to a gun.
* Some Time (no scope left) - Player gets some amount of time to start each day where they are allowed to move around without getting chased. They cannot be seen carrying things around though or else they will be caught. Dropping something and the orderly finding it will reset its position.
* None Time (some scope left) - Player gets no safe time. There will be certain environmental triggers the player can use to distract the orderly for a short time, but they are only usable once each treatment session.

As each of the treatments happen it gets later in the day and the environment gets dimmer and more ominous, but items get sparklier to see them better maybe? 

(Scope stretch goal) - Also things start to wear down, and become decrepit and spooky things might happen like people hiding behind walls and what not. 

Multiple Endings
* First ending most important: Exit through the [[Front Gate]] 
* (Scope stretch goal) -Any other freaking endings wooo yeah.
